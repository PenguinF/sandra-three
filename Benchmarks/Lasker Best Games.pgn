{Already the first move of the first game shows the profound psychology of
Emanuel Lasker. Against a lesser known opponent, he choses an offbeat opening
just to throw him off his guard.} 1. f4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. b3 {[pgndiagram] After
1..d5, White essentialy plays a reversed Dutch Defence} e6 4. Bb2 Be7 5. Bd3 $5
{A strange looking move, but not that bad at all. White blocks his d-pawn, but
develops his bishop on an agressive post.} b6 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. O-O O-O
{[pgndiagram] Black has developed naturally and is by no means worse. However,
now he has to find a concrete plan} 9. Ne2 $6 {This is probably not the best,
as it gives up a bishop pair for no compensation} (9. a4 a5 10. Qe1 {Trying to
bring the queen into attack, was interesting way. The position is
approximately equal}) 9... c5 $6 (9... Nc5 {Would have exchanged White's
dangerous light squared bishop and given Black an excellent position}) 10. Ng3
Qc7 11. Ne5 {[pgndiagram] Objectively, this jump shouldn't be dangerous, but
in those years, defence wasn't the strongest point of any chess player.} Nxe5
$2 {A mistake} (11... g6 {Was comparatively the best, blocking the d3 bishop
and preventing future Nh5, which  makes the knight on g3 look rather silly.})
12. Bxe5 $6 (12. fxe5 {Was much better, even though it blocks the bishop} Ne4 {
The best move} (12... Nd7 13. Qh5 h6 {Already the only move} (13... g6 {Is
losing immediately} 14. Qh6 {Now Nh5 is a deadly threat, there is also Rxf7 in
the air} Nxe5 (14... Rac8 15. Nh5) 15. Nh5) 14. Rf4 {And White has an
extremely dangerous attack}) 13. Bxe4 dxe4 14. Rf4 Rad8 15. Nxe4 {And White
has an excellent position}) 12... Qc6 13. Qe2 $6 {Allowing Black another
chance for g6} (13. Nh5 $1 {Was very good, solving the problem piece at once}
d4 14. Rf2) 13... a6 {[pgndiagram] And this is the decisive mistake. Making
this move for Black is complete luxury} (13... g6 {Was absolutely necessary.
It is not clear how White will continue}) 14. Nh5 $1 {Now White has a winning
attack} Nxh5 $2 {And this is going from the frying pan to fire} (14... Rfd8 {
Is the lesser evil} 15. Nxf6+ Bxf6 16. Bxh7+ Kf8 {And White retains an
advantage, but the game continues} (16... Kxh7 17. Qh5+ Kg8 18. Bxf6 gxf6 19.
Qh6 {[pgndiagram] And Black is busted})) 15. Bxh7+ $1 {[pgndiagram] The first
bishop sacrifice} Kxh7 16. Qxh5+ Kg8 17. Bxg7 $3 {[pgndiagram] The second
bishop sacrifice and the main reason why this not particularly important games
is famous nowadays. This attacking maneouvre is a typical idea nowadays, but
Lasker was first to discover it in over the board game} Kxg7 18. Qg4+ $1 {Very
important check, forcing the black king on the h-file} (18. Rf3 $2 {Would be a
terrible mistake} Rh8 19. Rg3+ Bg5 20. Rxg5+ Kf6 {[pgndiagram] And suddenly
White is lost}) 18... Kh7 19. Rf3 {Black has to give up his queen in order to
defend against mate} e5 20. Rh3+ Qh6 21. Rxh6+ Kxh6 22. Qd7 $1 {[pgndiagram]
And this is an additional problem. Without this move, Black would be probably
be able to resist, but now White wins one of the bishops and the game is
effectively decided} Bf6 23. Qxb7 {The rest is a matter of straightforward
technique} Kg7 24. Rf1 Rab8 25. Qd7 Rfd8 26. Qg4+ Kf8 27. fxe5 Bg7 28. e6 Rb7

35. Qxa6 d4 36. exd4 cxd4 37. h4 d3 38. Qxd3 {[pgndiagram] A beautiful

chess" that Lasker played} 1-0

1. e4 {[pgndiagram] This game was a must win for Lasker. Two rounds before the
finish, he was behind Capablanca by a whole point. Moreover, the Cuban had not
lost any games in the whole tournament before this encounter.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.
Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 $1 {An amazing decision. Although the Exchange Variation of the
Ruy Lopez was a formidable weapon in Lasker's hands, few could have thought
that it would work against Capablanca, whose virtuoso endgame technique was
already widely known.} dxc6 5. d4 (5. O-O {Nowadays, castling first is
considered as the best move. Robert James Fischer was the first to realize the
strength of this move}) 5... exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 {[pgndiagram]
Objectively speaking, White shouldn't claim any advantage in this position
whatsoever. Black has great compensation for the inferior pawn structure in
view of the two bishops and free development.} Bd6 (7... Bd7 {With castling
long has been played more often, with comfortable game}) 8. Nc3 Ne7 9. O-O O-O
10. f4 $6 {[pgndiagram] A rather double edged, objectively not a very good
move. White is burning his bridges prematurely. But Lasker is laying for the
win} (10. Be3 {Is more normal, although here White doesn't have the advantage})
10... Re8 {Black prevents Be3 due to a knight jump, and also threatens Bc5} (

[pgndiagram] "It has been wrongly claimed that this wins the game, but I would
like nothing better than to have such a position again" - Capablanca.   And
indeed, this move is double edged. On one hand it hands the e5 square for free,
but on the other hand, White eyes the e6 square.   However, under normal
circumstances he shouldn't be allowed to put his knight there} b6 13. Bf4 Bb7
$2 {Only this is a serious mistake, after which White's play is completely
justified} (13... Bxf4 14. Rxf4 c5 15. Rd1 Bb7 {Was more logical. The point is
that White's invasion is not dangerous} 16. Rd7 Rac8 {And his knight and rook
are stuck on b3 and f4. Black is better}) 14. Bxd6 cxd6 15. Nd4 {[pgndiagram]
Now Black has  to keep eye over e6. Although his pawn chain looks nice, it is
not that mobile and White's knights have many potential targets} Rad8 $2 {And
this is allowing too much. Capablanca is rather careless and allows the White
knight to resident permanently on e6} (15... Bc8 {Was neccessary, intending c5
next and preventing White's plan} 16. Rad1 c5 {And now White has to give up
the idea of occupying the e6 square} 17. Ne6 Bxe6 18. fxe6 Rad8 19. Nd5 Nc6 {
[pgndiagram] And White doesn't have any advantage}) 16. Ne6 {After this the
play is completely one sided} Rd7 17. Rad1 {[pgndiagram] Capablanca said that
he was now on point of playing c6-c5, but suddenly he became ambitious. 
Indeed, 17... c5 was better} Nc8 (17... c5 18. Rf3 $1 {Preventing d5 in a
tactical way} (18. Nd5 {Is the only move mentioned by Kasparov and Capablanca,
but here it seems Black can defend - the d6 weakness is shielded} Bxd5 (18...

Ba8 $2 {"Once again changing my plan and this time without any good reason" -
Capablanca.} (21... Rxe6 {Was indeed the best move} 22. fxe6+ Rxe6 {And Black
is very much in the game}) 22. Kf2 {[pgndiagram] Now White will push his
kingside pawns, opening a second front} Ra7 (22... h5 $2 {Simply loses a pawn}

bound to break through sooner or later. The advance of the kingside pawns
makes a big difference}) 25. h4 axb4 26. axb4 Rae7 $6 {[pgndiagram] It was
probably wiser not to move the rook from the a-file} (26... Ra3 {Is a blank
shot though} 27. g5) (26... Rh8 {Awaiting the opening of the h-file, was more
subtle. White shouldn't rush, but prepare it with say} 27. Rg1 Ra3 28. g5 {

{To this day, the conditions surrounding this game aren't clear. According to
some sources, the regulations of the match included a two point clause;
Schlechter needed to win the match by a two point margin.  However, it is not
clear whether such a clause existed. Schlechter's aggressive play was
attributed to the fact that he was quite honorable and he played for the win
in order not to win a match by a "fluke", after Lasker's blunder from a better
position in game 5.  We may never find out the truth, but the players have
provided us with a fantastic game nevertheless.} 1. d4 {This is the first time

{To this day, the conditions surrounding this game aren't clear. According to
some sources, the regulations of the match included a two point clause;
Schlechter needed to win the match by a two point margin.  However, it is not
clear whether such a clause existed. Schlechter's aggressive play was
attributed to the fact that he was quite honorable and he played for the win
in order not to win a match by a "fluke", after Lasker's blunder from a better
position in game 5.  We may never find out the truth, but the players have
provided us with a fantastic game nevertheless.} 1. d4 {This is the first time

[pgndiagram] Suddenly, all Black's pieces are far away from home} Rh2+ 50. Ka3
Rc2 $2 {Missing a tactical nuance, allowing White to win c6 and defend his own
c3 soldier} (50... Kf4 {Would have allowed Black to go for the more important
pawn - the a pawn.} 51. Rxc6 Bf5 52. Ra6 Bb1 53. Kb4 Rxa2 54. Na4 {And White
will win the a7 pawn, but it is hard to judge whether the resulting endgame is
a draw or not}) 51. Nd3 Kh4 52. Ne5 Bf5 53. Rxc6 {[pgndiagram] Now Black
doesn't have counterplay (Bb1 is impossible) and White is winning} Kg3 54. Rc5

against his former competitor, although it has to be admitted that Pillsbury
was merely a shadow of his former self at this moment .} 1-0

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 {No exchange this time} d6 {A familiar
variation} 5. O-O Nge7 6. c3 Bd7 7. d4 Ng6 8. Re1 Be7 9. Nbd2 (9. d5 Nb8 10.
Bc2 $5) 9... O-O 10. Nf1 Qe8 $6 {This is highly artificial} (10... exd4 11.
cxd4 b5 12. Bb3 Bf6 {Was interesting}) 11. Bc2 $1 {[pgndiagram] A good move,
emphasizing the lack of space that Black pieces don't enjoy. Avoiding
exchanges while having more space is a good rule of thumb one should follow} (
11. d5 {Is now inferior} Nd4 {Revealing the point behind Qe8}) 11... Kh8 12.
Ng3 (12. Ne3 {Preventing Bg4 and eyeing f5, was probably even better}) 12...
Bg4 (12... Nh4 {Comes to mind} 13. d5 Nb8 14. Nxh4 Bxh4 15. Bd2 a5) 13. d5 Nb8
14. h3 Bc8 $6 (14... Bxf3 {Was comparatively better} 15. Qxf3 Nd7 {With
inferior position}) 15. Nf5 $1 {[pgndiagram] Now White gets a very strong
attack} Bd8 (15... Bxf5 $2 {Is a bad decision} 16. exf5 Nh4 17. Ng5 {And White
is winning the wayward knight}) 16. g4 $5 {The centre is blocked and there is
no counterplay on the other side of the board. Therefore White is correct to
start pushing the pawns on the kingside, even if his own king is residing
there.} Ne7 17. Ng3 (17. Be3 {Was also possible, since Black doesn't really
want to take on f5}) 17... Ng8 18. Kg2 Nd7 19. Be3 Nb6 $6 {It was probably
wiser to keep this knight closer to the kingside} (19... Ne7) 20. b3 Bd7 21. c4
Nc8 22. Qd2 Nce7 23. c5 $1 {[pgndiagram] Now Lasker opens up another front and
can choose on which wing he wants to play. Since he has more space, it is
easier for him to move his pieces from one side of the board to another.} g6 $2
{The losing move. Black willingly weakens his kingside for no good reason} (
23... b6 24. b4 a5 {Playing on the queenside, was better}) 24. Qc3 f5 $2 {This
faulty plan by Black is met with a thunderous response} 25. Nxe5 $3 {
[pgndiagram] A great sacrifice} dxe5 26. Qxe5+ $2 {Unfortunately, Lasker
doesn't crown his play with a brilliant stroke} (26. g5 $3 {Was a fantastic
way to win the game} Nc8 (26... Nc6 27. f4 $1) 27. exf5 gxf5 28. Bd2 {And
Black is busted}) 26... Nf6 27. Bd4 fxg4 28. hxg4 Bxg4 (28... Kg8 {Was a
better defence} 29. g5 Nexd5 30. exd5 Qxe5 31. Rxe5 Ng4 32. Re2 Bxg5 {And
suddenly Black has a perfectly playable position}) 29. Qg5 Qd7 30. Bxf6+ Kg8
31. Bd1 Bh3+ 32. Kg1 Nxd5 $2 {[pgndiagram] And this is a final mistake in a
difficult position} (32... h6 33. Qh4 Nxd5 34. Bxd8 Qf7 {Was more tricky.
White would be forced to find a precise way fo consolidate his advantage after}
35. Ne2 (35. f3 Nf4 36. Nf5 (36. Be7 Qg7 {Is not so clear}) 36... gxf5 37. Qxf4
Qg7+ {And the rook on a1 is falling}) 35... Raxd8 36. exd5 Rxd5 37. f4 {
[pgndiagram] And White is winning. But Black still has some counterchances})
33. Bxd8 Nf4 (33... Qf7 34. f3 Nf4 35. Nf5 {Is a huge difference compared to
variation with the queen on h4}) 34. Bf6 {[pgndiagram] Now the game is over
and Lasker concludes it in a spectacular fashion} Qd2 35. Re2 Nxe2+ 36. Bxe2
Qd7 37. Rd1 Qf7 38. Bc4 Be6 39. e5 Bxc4 40. Nf5 {A brilliant, one sided game,
in which Lasker relinquished his advantage only briefly, and essentialy
dominated from start to finish} 1-0
