Sandra 3 was inspired by ideas from various sources. They all deserve bountiful credit for their work.

Disclaimer:
I did not copy any code from either of these sources. Feel free to copy mine though, as long as you keep in mind that I attached the Apache License to it, to ensure that:

1) Even though I wrote the code, using it properly remains your responsibility.
2) You cannot claim the code as your intellectual property, denying me the right to use my own code.


Here then are the credits:
