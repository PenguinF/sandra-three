# sandra-three
Third incarnation of a chess UI for Windows 7 and higher.

Aim of this project is twofold. The reason I put this on github and why I documented things so heavily is to show what can be achieved with Windows Forms controls and GDI+ in an age of an ever increasing flood of new APIs, tools and languages. If this 25 year old technology is the right tool for some job, then its age should not be a reason to reject it.

My personal goal is to research what an ideal chess UI would look and feel like to me.

***

Sandra 1 was coded in Delphi in 2004-2005.
Sandra 2 was a dead end research project.

Sandra 3 targets the .NET framework 4.5.2, and is coded in C# 6.

Sandra is that unique miracle woman who became a member of chess club SVDrienerlo. Everybody secretly admires her, and some guys are rumoured to have held beer tournaments just to decide who gets to play her next in the club competition. Not me, of course.
